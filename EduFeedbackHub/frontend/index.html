<!--
  This is the main HTML template for the React application.
  It defines the basic structure of the webpage including metadata and the root div where React renders.
  The React app's JavaScript bundle (main.jsx) is loaded as a module to start the app.
  React will dynamically render all components inside the div with id="root".
  This file usually resides in the 'public' folder and serves as the single HTML page for the SPA.
